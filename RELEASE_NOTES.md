# Backup Utility v5.0 Release Notes

## What's New

### Redesigned Interface

The application has been completely rebuilt with a modern tabbed interface:

- **Backup tab** — Configure and start backups
- **Monitor tab** — Watch progress in real-time with item-by-item status
- **Schedules tab** — Set up automatic backups without editing or managing config files

### Secure Password Storage

Your passwords are now optionally stored securely in Windows Credential Manager for both on-demand and scheduled backups. or SSO organizations, OAuth tokens are also stored securely so scheduled backups can run unattended without requiring built-in user authentication (scheduled backups now work with SSO-only and MFA-enforced logins).

### Built-in Scheduling

Set up daily, weekly, or monthly backups directly in the app. No more editing XML files or using Task Scheduler manually. Schedules run even when you're logged out.

### Settings That Stick

Your configuration is saved automatically. Close the app, reopen it tomorrow — everything is right where you left it.

### Proxy Support

Configure an HTTP/HTTPS proxy in the Advanced section if your network requires it.
